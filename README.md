# Overview
This is a study repository which I use to register my code and notes about what I'm currently studying related to Data Structures and Algorithms

## Disposition
My current main source of study is the book Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide. I may change or add sources as I go on, as the book seems pretty simple for now.

The root contains a folder for each chapter, which will contain folders for subjects with code in each language I'm currently studying, containing my implementations of DSA. For each chapter, there will be a general README.md file for notes and thought proccess.

## Goals
- To understand computer fundamentals;
- Learn how to implement complex structures with different resources;
- Create problem solving skills.

This repo is currently under frequent updates.
