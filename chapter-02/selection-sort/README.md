# Selection Sort
This is a sorting algorithm used to ordenate a given array by getting it's smallest elements and arrranging them in another structure.

## How to implement
The way of implementing it is:
For each iteration, based on the length of the array under analysis
- Separate the smallest number by the time of iteration;
- Remove that number from the original array;
- Repeat til you have a new array ordenated by crescent order.

## Complexity of operation
This is a O(n^2) complexity algorithm, as it iterates over the array the number of its elements times, so it1s performance depends on the number of items that are being included in the operation.
